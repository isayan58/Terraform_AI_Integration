# Delve_AI

In this project, we are trying to automate the modification of cloud infrastructure with Terraform in the backend but reducing the involvement of IaC developers even further by integrating AI into the solution. If and when this works out, this solution will be robust and will be able to deploy infrastructure in a matter of clicks.
